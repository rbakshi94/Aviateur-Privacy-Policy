      <p></p>
      <p>
        I (Rajat Bakshi) built the Aviateur app as an ad-free app. The app is
        provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the
        collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information for further use
        of Aviateur app.
      </p>
      <p>
        By choosing to continue using Aviateur app, you agree to the collection
        and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal
        Information collected by the app is used for providing and improving the
        in-app services and features. This information will not be shared with
        anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <p id="titles">Information Collection and Use</p>
      <p>
        Upon the user launching the app for the first time on a device, the app
        initializes graphics quality settings based on the device's available
        Random Access Memory (RAM) on the user's device. The available RAM
        amount is used to make a guess on the device's graphics rendering
        capabilities. The information regarding RAM amount read from the user's
        device is not stored by the app.
      </p>

      <p id="titles">Log Data</p>
      <p>
        Upon your agreement to this Privacy Policy and further use of Aviateur
        app, if the app is deemed to be unstable in its intended functions by

        (through third party services) on your device, known as Log Data. This
        Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol
        (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration
        of the app, the time and date of your use of Aviateur app, and other

      </p>

      <p id="titles">Security</p>
      <p>
        Aviateur app strives to use commercially acceptable means of protecting
        your Personal Information. However, no method of transmission over the
        internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable.

        third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these
        external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you

        and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
